#In order to get access to the the spotify Web API we need to create an application
#Step one: creating an application and getting a unique client id and secret
#using kristine's application id 
"""
The Reason we are using SpotifyClientCredentials is becuase it gets information from Spotify
data that is not linked to a user, just the music. 
SpotifyOAuth is the one that gives user specific data such as recently played songs
SCOPE: tells us which data specifically to use. I would choose 'user-top-read' which shows
the top music of the user.
